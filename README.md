## Ideas

- Different size/mass people
- Force through the throng to get a drink
- Dance without spilling
- Bash everyone out of the way, maybe a circular area
- Spin around, spin dash, etc
- Berzerker mode, neck your drink and go mental
- "Someone fell over, protect them!"
- "A druggy is after you, run away!"
- "Someone's drink was spiked, knock it out of their hand!"
- "You need your space! Try and distance yourself from everyone"
- Actual music (CC / composed / stream?)
